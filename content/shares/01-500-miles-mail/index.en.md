Welcome to the new *shares* section of my blog !

I'll start with a not-so-famous story about emails.
**The strange case of the 500 miles mails.**

A chairman contacting its sysadmin about mail which can't reach their destination if it's more than 500 miles.

I'm not sure this story is genuine but it is very good and well written.

Here is your [webpage](http://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html) - [local cached version](original).

Sorry for not translating all my french content but it takes a lot of work to produce such a great frenglish like i doâ€¦
