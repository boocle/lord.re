<H1>The $5000 Compression Challenge</H1>
Apart from the $100 cash I sent him, the emails below are a complete record of
all the correspondence between myself and Mike Goldman. The only editing I have
done is to remove some line breaks and to replace potentially sensitive information
with asterisks. I left in my typos (e.g. wc -b -> wc -c, Digital Linux -> Digital UNIX)<BR>

I came across this challenge while browsing the

<PRE>
Mike Goldman <whig@by.net> makes another offer:

    I will attach a prize of $5,000 to anyone who successfully meets this
    challenge.  First, the contestant will tell me HOW LONG of a data file to
    generate.  Second, I will generate the data file, and send it to the
    contestant.  Last, the contestant will send me a decompressor and a
    compressed file, which will together total in size less than the original
    data file, and which will be able to restore the compressed file to the
    original state.

    With this offer, you can tune your algorithm to my data.  You tell me the
    parameters of size in advance.  All I get to do is arrange the bits within
    my file according to the dictates of my whim.  As a processing fee, I will
    require an advance deposit of $100 from any contestant.  This deposit is
    100% refundable if you meet the challenge.

This sounds like an interesting challenge. Is it still available? Can
you give a few more details about the decompressor. Does it have to run
on any machine or is just one machine ok. How do you define a
decompressor? Does this script count as a decompressor:

gunzip $1

Thanks in advance for your reply

<B class="him">You tell me how large a file to make and send me $100.

I make it and send it to you.

You send me a compressed file and a decompressor which together are
less than the size of my uncompressed file, and which can together
regenerate the original uncompressed file.

I send you $5,000.

If you fail, you send me another $100 and try again.</B>

for a way to send a money order online using a credit card. I found
sendmoneyorder.com, but they require you to send a photocopy of your credit card

that will allow me to do this from Japan?

Alternatively I could just send $100 cash. I also have a bank account in England
so I could send you an English check (they don't have checks in Japan) for the
equivalent in British pounds (plus a bit extra for the inconvenience).

In order to meet the challenge you must provide to me a

Now that you have the data with which you will be working, I am

     Date: Mon, 02 Apr 2001 17:32:46 -0400 
     Organization: Posted via Supernews, http://www.supernews.com 



<B class="him">Quick update...

My compression challenge (which can be found in the
comp.compression faq in part 1, section 8) has been accepted.

The contestant has sent me $100 as a processing fee and requested
that I generate a 3 megabyte file for him to attempt to compress.
According to the rules of the contest, he must send me back a
compressed file and a decompressor which together total in size
less than the original file, and which can correctly regenerate the
original uncompressed file.  If he can do so, he will receive
$5,000 plus refund of his processing fee.

Thanks to random.org for providing me with a source of high-quality
true random values for use in this contest.

Before naming the individual and giving additional details of our
correspondence, I would like to give him some time to analyze the
data I will be sending him.  It would be very easy to point out to
him the impossibility of his task, but far more interesting to see
how long he will struggle with the problem before realizing it for
himself.

I am supposing that one of his fellow co-workers probably referred
him to my challenge, as I cannot fathom that someone would read the
comp.compression faq first and then want to participate after
understanding the futility of the effort.  On the other hand, some
people just don't understand information theory too well.

I'll try to give him a complete explanation of his error after a
week or so, I guess.  :)</B>

<H2><A NAME="Random">Compressing random data and self compressing / extracting files</A></H2>
<BR>
It's a mathematical fact that it's impossible to uniquely represent every byte sequence
of length n by another single byte sequence that is at least one byte shorter than n.
This is because there are fewer sequences that are smaller than size n (by any
amount, not just one byte smaller) than there are sequences of size n, so some
of the original sequences would be represented by the same sequence.<BR>
<BR>
However, the challenge isn't to compress any possible data, it's to recreate one
file from a compressed file and a decompressor whose combined file sizes are
less than the uncompressed file size.
Assuming that the person who generates the file knows what they're doing,
this is quite difficult if you're only allowed one compressed file.
They will probably give you a file that has been output from some
sort of random number generator. A randomly generated file could contain
anything so you have to hope that they give you something that contains
a particular sequence or sequences of bytes that enables you to complete the
challenge. It is theoretically possible for a random number generator to
output a large file that just contains ASCII text. This could be compressed
with gzip and uncompressed with this decompression script (which Mike Goldman
would allow as a decompressor):<BR>
<BR>
gunzip $1<BR>
<BR>
The person generating the file would probably notice if it contained just
ASCII text or anything else that could be compressed with a standard
compression program, so you have to hope for something that is more difficult
to spot. E.g. consider the following decompression script:<BR>
<PRE>
cat $1
printf "X"
cat $0
exit
</PRE>
NOTE: Any garbage can appear after the newline following the exit command and
this script will still execute. If you don't require a clean exit you don't
even need the exit command.<BR>
<BR>
This script is one possible arrangement of 30 bytes that could occur in a randomly
generated file. If these 30 bytes are preceded by an X character (X could
be any printable character) in the file,
you can split the file into two, all characters up to the X in one file and all
characters after the X in the other file and discard the X, saving one byte.
The first file is the compressed file (comp.dat) and the second file is the
decompressor (decompress).
You can then regenerate the original file (original.dat) using the following
command:<BR>
<BR>
decompress comp.dat &gt;  original.dat<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: There is no requirement in the challenge to store the original filename
in the compressed file.<BR>
<BR>
The first drawback to this approach is that you need quite a large file
to be fairly confident of getting the required byte sequence in the file.
This byte sequence would occur on average once in a random file whose size was
256^31 bytes, i.e. about 4.2e+65 Gb. You would probably want to ask for a file
that was about 1000 times as big as that to give yourself more chance.
The second drawback is that the person generating the file may have read
this, so you would have to look for something different, e.g.<BR>
<BR>
<PRE>
ac t1$p
irtn fX"
"ddi =f0$c no=vwsbae
ix
t
</PRE>
If you swap pairs of characters in this sequence, you get:<BR>
<BR>
<PRE>
cat $1
printf "X"
dd if=$0 conv=swab
exit
</PRE>
If the first sequence appeared in your random file and was preceded by an X,
you could put all the characters up to the X in the compressed file and
put all the characters after the X in the decompessor and discard the X.
You would need to
do a bit of extra processing in this case, namely swapping byte pairs
in the decompressor. (Example files with 1000 byte original.dat - 
<A HREF=swab.tar.gz>swab.tar.gz</A>).
This script is also a bit longer (42 bytes)
so you would have to ask for a bigger file (256^43*1000 bytes) to have a good chance of
it occurring in the file. This decompressor also suffers from the second
drawback above, so you would probably need to look for something else, etc, etc...<BR>
<BR>
It's probably also possible to meet the challenge with smaller file sizes by
storing information in the filename of the compressed file or the
decompressor, but I think most people would consider this to be
cheating. Another cheat would be to use command line options or user
input to regenerate some or all of the original data. Taken to extremes,
this method could be used to compress every file to nothing! To compress
the file you simply delete it. The only problem is that in order to
regenerate the original file, the user has to remember not only the
original filename, but also the exact contents, byte by byte, of
the original file as this information has to be entered into the
"decompressor" in order to regenerate the original file. Does storing
data in the human brain instead of on computer disk count as compression?<BR>
<BR>
Luckily for me, Mike Goldman allowed me to use several compressed files.
This makes the challenge easy to complete without cheating (at least in my opinion).<BR>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="Programs">Completing the challenge - the compressor and decompressor</A></H2>
The restated challenge is to reconstruct the original file using a decompressor and
several compressed files whose total file size is less than the original file size.
Using the method below, you can save on average one byte for every 256 bytes in the
original file. The size of the decompressor and the extra information required to
reconstruct the original file is 161 + length of original filename (I wanted to
store the filename in the compressed files even though there was no requirement
to do so). Assuming the original filename was a sensible size (e.g. 8.3), the
original file needed to be at least about 45kb. I asked for a 3Mb file
to allow for a ridiculously long filename and to give plenty of additional
leeway.<BR>
<BR>
The file Mike Goldman gave me was original.dat.
GeoCities doesn't let you use files with a .dat extension. Instead you can download the same file
renamed to .gz, <A HREF="original.gz">original.gz</A>.
The correct file size is 3,145,728 bytes.<BR>
<BR>
This file looks fairly random and can't be compressed with any standard compression
program. I wrote a simple program to compress this file (compiled on Windows NT -
<A HREF="AaahAa.exe">AaahAa.exe</A>):<BR>
<PRE>
<CODE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

	while (!feof(in))
	{

		size++;
	}
	fclose(in);
	_splitpath(argv[1], NULL, NULL, infile, inext);
	maxCompress = count+strlen(infile)+strlen(inext)+PADDING;
	if (size - maxCompress < 1)
	{

	}
	do
	{

		if (scanf("%d",&compression) != 1) compression = 0;
		scanf("%*[^\n]");
		getchar();
	}
	while ((compression < 1) || (compression &gt;  maxCompress));
	do
	{
		printf("Basename for output files?");
		if (scanf("%c%s",outfile,outfile+1) != 2) outfile[0] = 0;
		scanf("%*[^\n]");
		getchar();
	}
	while(outfile[0] == 0);
	numFiles = compression+strlen(infile)+strlen(inext)+PADDING;
	dot = outfile + strlen(outfile);
	out = fopen(outfile,"wb");
	fprintf(out,"%s%s\n%d\n",infile,inext,numFiles);
	fclose(out);
	out = NULL;
	in = fopen(argv[1],"rb");
	if (in == NULL) return EXIT_FAILURE;
	for (i = 0; i < numFiles; i++)
	{

		sprintf(dot,".%d",i);
		out = fopen(outfile,"wb");
		c = getc(in);

			fputc(c,out);
			c = getc(in);
		}
	}
	while(!feof(in))
	{
		fputc(c,out);
		c = getc(in);
	}
	fclose(out);
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</CODE>
</PRE>
I used this program to compress the file by 200 bytes
(156 bytes for the decompressor plus one byte to complete the challenge plus a
bit for luck) and produced 219 files named comp, comp.0, comp.1, comp.2, ..., comp.217.<BR>
<BR>
The contents of the first file (comp) are:<BR>
<BR>
<CODE>
<PRE>
original.dat
218
</PRE>
</CODE>
The decompressor is called <A HREF="dfi">dfi</A> and is the following script:<BR>
<CODE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
i=0
f=`head -1 $1`
n=`tail -1 $1`
rm -f $f
while [ $i != $n ]; do
cat $1.$i >> $f
i=`expr $i + 1`
if [ $i != $n ]; then printf "5" >> $f; fi
done
</PRE>
</CODE>
The original file can be regenerated by running this decompressor on the compressed files:<BR>
<BR>
dfi comp<BR>
<BR>
The total file size of the decompressor (156 bytes) and all the compressed files
(3,145,528 bytes) is 3,145,684 bytes. The original file is 3,145,728 bytes, so I successfully
completed the challenge.<BR>
<BR>
This can be confirmed by downloading <A HREF="comp.tar.gz">comp.tar.gz</A>, a
gzipped tar file containing the decompressor and all the compressed files.
Unsurprisingly, this file is actually larger than the original data file.<BR>

The decompressor is called dfi and the compressed files are called comp, comp.0, comp.1,
... comp.217. Download everything in the out directory to the same directory. You will
probably need to make the decompressor executable, e.g.

chmod +x dfi

You then decompress your file by running

./dfi comp

The total file size of the compressed files (wc -b comp*) is

3145528 bytes

The decompressor is

156 bytes

Making a total of

3145684 bytes

The original file is

3145728 bytes

Which means the total file size of the decompressor and compressed files is 44 bytes
less than the uncompressed file and I have completed the challenge.

I have tested the decompressor on the following operating systems:
Linux
AIX
SunOS
IRIX
Digital Linux
Windows (with cygwin tools installed)
and found it to work correctly.

When you have confirmed that I have completed the challenge, I will tell you how you can

<B class="him">Hello Patrick,

I have accessed your server and downloaded exactly two files, the "decompressor" (dfi) and
the "compressed file" (comp).

The rest of the files in the directory (comp.0 through comp.217 inclusive) I have not
touched.  You may ascertain that this is true if you wish to view your ftp server logs.

Note that dfi is unable to reconstruct the original.dat file from comp.  Contrary to the
requirements of the challenge, a textual analysis of the "decompressor" reveals that you
did absolutely nothing whatsoever even to attempt compression of the data which I
previously sent you.  Rather, you simply split the file into 218 parts ending with the
character "5" and then stripped that final character from each part.  Thus the
"decompressor" is nothing more than a reassembler, concatenating the parts and reappending
the character "5" after each.  While I have not downloaded the said 218 parts, it is a
certainty that they are either exactly as I have described them to be, or else they are not
capable of being reassembled into the original data by the dfi script you provided.

In further point of fact, the 218 parts together must occupy more space than the original
file (original.dat) that you were given.  Each file requires space for a directory entry,
and each such directory entry requires in excess of one byte of space.  Thus you have in
actuality expanded the data which you were given to compress.

You have compressed no data.  It does not appear that you ever intended to do so.  Perhaps
you misunderstood the terms or the objective of the challenge.  If so, and you promptly
submit your withdrawal of your challenge acceptance, I shall refund your $100 processing
fee in consideration of this misunderstanding.  If you insist on pressing your request for
$5,000 I shall be forced to defend against any such claim on the basis that you did not
satisfy the requirements of the challenge, and, if necessary, for fraud.</B>

the original file. I think anyone would agree that if you sent me an uncompressed file of size

&gt; You have compressed no data.  It does not appear that you ever intended to do so.  Perhaps
&gt; you misunderstood the terms or the objective of the challenge.  If so, and you promptly
&gt; submit your withdrawal of your challenge acceptance, I shall refund your $100 processing
&gt; fee in consideration of this misunderstanding.  If you insist on pressing your request for
&gt; $5,000 I shall be forced to defend against any such claim on the basis that you did not
&gt; satisfy the requirements of the challenge, and, if necessary, for fraud.

<B class="me">Obviously, I would like you to send me the $5000 as promised, but I never really expected you
to. I'm surprised we went as far as we did. I thought you were going to pull out the morning
after the original emails after realising your mistake. You can keep the $100.

By the way, I think I could theoretically complete the original challenge, but the uncompressed
file would be impossible large and you would probably argue that the files weren't really a
compressed file and a decompressor anyway.

I would rather you didn't reveal my identity or give additional details of our correspondence
to the comp.compression newsgroup.

Thanks

<B class="him">The challenge was specifically regarding data compression.  Perhaps it will be necessary to
restate the terms in a legalistic form which is not open to this sort of miscommunication, but
I believe the intention was clear from the plain English wording.  One can engage in "data hiding"
through a number of approaches, and it is true that you took a somewhat novel approach to this in
your own case.  One might likewise shift part of the data to the filename of the "compressed" file
and/or to that of the "decompressor" itself.  Much in this way does gzip retain the filename of
the uncompressed original -- by creating a new file with the characters ".gz" appended.  However
this would also not qualify as data compression -- it is moving data from one part of the
filesystem to another, but no data is saved.  (Gzip does perform data compression in many cases,
but it does not perform filename compression.)

Likewise in your case, the use of 218 separate files implicitly does nothing more than set an
equivalency of EOF = "5", and then makes such a substitution.  However, EOF does not consume less
space than "5", no compression has occurred, data has been shifted or "hidden" from the file
itself to another part of the filesystem.

By contrast, if your "decompressor" did not make use of such tricks as this, as in your example of
having a compressed file of 599 bytes and a decompressor of 400 bytes, I believe the terms of the
challenge would be met.  The question is whether real compression took place.</B>

<B class="him">I think that I did not make a mistake except to believe that you truly intended to attempt to
compress the data I was sending you.  I do appreciate your graciousness in this, my offer to
return the $100 stands if you change your mind, as this was never intended as a money making
enterprise but merely a discouragement to insincere challengers from wasting my time.

Alternately, you could still take up the original challenge if you like, with the understanding
that you must actually compress data to meet the requirements.  I have heard the argument that
given a suffiently large dataset it should be possible to find a more efficient representation,
however this is not true.  From an information theoretic standpoint when dealing with true random
data that has been skew-corrected, the most efficient representation for the value of each bit is
precisely one bit, not more and not less.  Flagging any slightly compressible portion of the data
stream will require more overhead bytes than will be gained in compression.  This would obviously
have to consider using the filesystem for doing the flagging as part of the overhead, at minimum
to consider the EOF = flag substitution to consume a byte (actually it must consume at least 9
bits).

I would gladly submit any such submission to an impartial ombudsman to determine the question of
whether data compression has occurred.</B>

<B class="me">I don't know much about compression theory, but I would define a compressed file as a file that

from compressed files by the use of information or algorithms internal to the decompressor.</B>

the following:

1. Don't reveal my identity or information regarding the ftp server.
2. State that you allowed me to use multiple compressed files before I accepted the challenge.
3. Explain how I "completed" the challenge and show the contents of the dfi and comp files. You can
say whatever you like about the method as long as you explain how it works.
4. Don't do any "creative editing" of our emails in order to change their original meaning.

Might generate a bit of discussion about what constitutes a compressed file and a decompressor ;-)

Mike Goldman never replied to my last email, so I posted this web page to the
comp.compression newsgroup on 16th April. This generated a fair bit of discussion
about who won and whether any compression had taken place. Below are extracts
from some of the emails posted. The full thread can be viewed

Mike was going
by the guidelines within the FAQ. The FAQ clearly outlines that filesystem
exploits are not true compression. I think it may have been short-sighted of
Goldman to allow multiple 'compressed' files, however, having the challenge
worded so loosely makes things interesting. :)

And yes, very good show Patrick.

I am certain having dealt with many bar room bets. Mike didn't
give a dam due to being smug about his winning. If anything he thought
Patrick was a bigger fool than he first thought. A common thing
in bar room bets. Mike knew he lost when Patrick sent him the files.
From that point on the emails were Mike trying to weasel out of the bet.
He know He lost them pretended to not understand by saying he checked
the 2 files and that Patrick failed. He knew he lost but tried to
change the rules after the action was over. Much like the deomcrats
in Florida.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I won because the bet was on the data length of the files. I specifically
stated the required length of the uncompressed file (3,145,728 bytes)
and that's what Mike Goldman gave me. The main argument against this is that
the file length should include the file header information as stated in the
compression FAQ. In his email to comp.compression, Mike states that he thought
I must be one of those people who "don't understand information theory too well"
and I couldn't possibly have read the FAQ or I wouldn't have taken the challenge.
Isn't it a bit unfair to expect me to play by rules I've never seen?<BR>

... and a little later...

  "I will withdraw my claim to the $5000 and allow you to...."

The way I read it, it's fairly clear that Patrick's main reason
for accepting the challenge was to show Mike how dangerous it can
be to make carelessly-worded challenges.

Who was trying to trick who?  Wasn't Mike trying to trick
some naive person into accepting a challenge that couldn't be met?  So
Patrick out-tricked the tricker....  that's the thing that great tales
are made of.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
My main motivation was to "out-trick the tricker". I thought the chances
of me making any money were very remote. If, after receiving the files,
Mike Goldman had said "Congratulations here's the $5000" I wouldn't have
complained or sent the money back. As soon as he threatened legal action,
it was obvious he wasn't going to pay up. From then on, I was just trying
to avoid the situation where he said that I had made up either the whole
thing or the emails where he agreed to multiple files. That's why I said
I didn't want the $5000 or for him to reveal my identity. I
thought that if he thought I wasn't going to say anything publicly it would
make him feel more secure and more likely to talk to me and other
people, and to tell the truth to comp.compression, thereby making it
more difficult to deny everything later on. I said he could keep
the $100 because I think that taking it back would be admitting that
I failed or cheated.<BR>
<BR>
I think the only reason Mike offered the $5000 prize was because he
was convinced that the challenge was impossible. He probably
thought that no one would ever take him up on it anyway.
When I showed an interest, he couldn't believe
his luck and allowed me to bend the rules a bit so he could
get my $100. In an ideal world he would send me the $5000.
In the real world nobody is that honest. This should be a
lesson to anyone else who wants to set (or take) such
challenges with high stakes.<BR>

<H3>Did I compress anything?</H3>

To show compression, you need to show space
savings, which has not been done here.  In fact, the disk space
required for the "compressed" data is substantially larger than the
disk space for the original data, since many more inodes/directory
entries are required.  It all goes back to "hiding information" in
the file length, which has been discussed here over and over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
There's almost universal agreement that I didn't compress anything, but
I don't think this is a requirement of the challenge anyway. I still think I
compressed the data in the original file. It's not my fault that
a file system uses up more space storing the same amount of data
in two files rather than a single file.<BR>
