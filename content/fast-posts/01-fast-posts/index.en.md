Here is a new section on my web site. **Fast posts**. I post more and more on my site. I try to produce content of *better quality*. Articles become *longer* and *need more work*.

You probably notice that i *greatly increased the release rythm*. At first it was tedious but it comes more naturally now. I find it quite appealing writing on my site. I'd like publishing *more regularly* but if i stick to big complexes articles I won't be able to sustain this effort for long. So I decided to open a new section dedicated to *shorter articles*. I'll probably react to *news headlines*.

For now I'm not sure how to differentiate the content on the site. I tweaked the theme i use and probably continue in the following weeks. I hope my english writing skills will improve. I do my best but even in the French version there are a lot of spelling mistakes.
