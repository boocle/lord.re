Holy shit ! I'm posting more regularly ! I'll soon become an influent blogger ! Well. As I said earlier I decided to fix the encoding mess. To be quick i changed my locales to only have *en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8* . I created */etc/env.d/02locale* where i force my locales variables and it's done ! Now I only need to configure goold old Vim and ugly Putty to make them only work with utf-8. Now I can show off with lots of weird characters 	: Ϣ о҉ ۩ ༄ ←↓→↑ ↙↓↘ ↖↑↗
