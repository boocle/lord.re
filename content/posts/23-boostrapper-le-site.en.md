It's time ! What should be has been done. A new design for my weblog. And this time i fell in the infamous twitter's ***Bootstrap***. C'est clean and classy. It's almost the same thing as every other website but it's convenient.

Bootstrap is a combo of javascript and CSS to make clean website in a breeze. You just need to apply some classes to your elements. A little *span9* and it inherits all the properties. You just need to choose a theme and there you go. You even have small icons as a font. It's the first time than my website use something that i haven't made. But it's also the first time my website isn't ugly as duckâ€¦

I promise you that we will soon have images to enhance the site. Ok now you can switch off your brain, i'll beep you in two/three months for another blogpost.
