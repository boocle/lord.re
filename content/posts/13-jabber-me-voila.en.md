During my questo to digital independance, to freedom and privacy I now just installed a jabber server (ejabberd). I'm going to leave msn, icq and all. You now can contact me through jabber with my mail adress. It's quite clean and way better than Microsoft Shitty Network.
I also installed a tiny wiki for my personal "GED".

*PS 2017 :* I quitted jabber some months later. I don't need it. In fact the only instant messaging i still use is IRC. It may last many years. I also dropped the wiki. I rely on micro snippet inside the shell (see the foldcat article).
