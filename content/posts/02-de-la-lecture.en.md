Here it is, I migrated from Debian to Gentoo and i transformed this pc to a server... I removed X. This made it feels way lighter. Without the webserver running it only eats thirty MB of ram. That's way better than the 250 eaten by Debian. And it's all heavily customized. Enough reading for today. Cya.
